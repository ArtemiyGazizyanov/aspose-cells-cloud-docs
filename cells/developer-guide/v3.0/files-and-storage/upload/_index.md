This REST API indicates `upload file`.

## RSET API
 
```bash
 
PUT http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/storage/file/{path}
 
```
The request parameters are: 
 
| Parameter Name | Type | Path/Query String/HTTPBody | Description| 
| :- | :- | :- |:- | 
| path | string | path | Path where to upload including filename and extension e.g. /file.ext or /Folder 1/file.ext If the content is multipart and path does not contains the file name it tries to get them from filename parameter from Content-Disposition header. |
| file | File | formData | File to upload |
| storageName | string | query | Storage name |
 
The [OpenAPI Specification](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/cells/#/UploadFile) defines a publicly accessible programming interface and lets you carry out REST interactions directly from a web browser.
 
You can use cURL command-line tool to access Aspose.Cells web services easily. The following example shows how to make calls to Cloud API with cURL.
 
{{< tabs tabTotal="2" tabID="11" tabName11="Request" tabName12="Response" >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="11" >}}
 
```bash
 
curl -v "http://api.aspose.cloud/v3.0/cells/storage/file/Book1.xlsx" \
-X PUT \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt token>"
-d {"File":{}}
```
 
{{< /tab >}}
 
{{< tab tabNum="12" >}}
 
```bash
{
  "Uploaded": [
    "string"
  ],
  "Errors": [
    {
      "Code": "string",
      "Message": "string",
      "Description": "string",
      "InnerError": {
        "RequestId": "string",
        "Date": "2021-12-02T03:21:11.704Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
 
```
 
{{< /tab >}}
 
{{< /tabs >}}
 
## Cloud SDK Family
 
Using an SDK is the best way to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of low-level details and lets you focus on your project tasks. Please check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-cells-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.Cells Cloud SDKs.
 
The following code examples demonstrate how to make calls to Aspose.Cells web services using various SDKs:
